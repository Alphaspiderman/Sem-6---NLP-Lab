# Report on Chatbot for Customer Support

## Abstract
This report outlines the development and implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based chatbot designed to assist customers with common queries related to a company's services. The chatbot aims to understand user intent, extract relevant entities, and provide appropriate responses. The process involves collecting and formatting a dataset of customer queries, building and training a model for intent classification, evaluating its performance, and implementing Named Entity Recognition (NER) for entity extraction. The report also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using a chatbot for customer support.

## Steps

1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Collect a dataset of customer queries. This can be done using a pre-existing dataset (e.g., Chatbot Corpus, Intent Recognition Dataset) or by creating synthetic data.

2. **Dataset Formatting**:
   - Format the dataset to include:
     - User queries
     - Intent labels (e.g., "Order Status", "Product Inquiry", "Refund Request")
     - Entities (e.g., "Order ID", "Product Name")
   - Deliverable: A labeled dataset ready for training.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Build a model to classify user intent. Possible models include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT or DistilBERT) (Optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for intent classification.

5. **Entity Extraction**:
   - Implement a trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model capable of extracting entities like "Order ID", "Date", or "Product Name" from user queries.

## Python Code

Below is a simplified example of how to implement the steps using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Hugging Face's Transformers.

### Step 1: Dataset Collection and Formatting

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example synthetic dataset
data = {
    'user_query': [
        "What is the status of my order?",
        "I want to know about the refund process.",
        "Can you tell me about the product I ordered?",
        "Where is my order ID 12345?",
    ],
    'intent': [
        "Order Status",
        "Refund Request",
        "Product Inquiry",
        "Order Status"
    ],
    'entities': [
        None,
        None,
        "Product Name",
        "Order ID"
    ]
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('customer_support_dataset.csv', index=False)
```

### Step 2: Model Building and Training

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('customer_support_dataset.csv')

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['user_query'], df['intent'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Vectorization
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Model training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vectorized)

# Evaluation
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Step 3: Entity Extraction (Using SpaCy)

```python
import spacy

# Load SpaCy model for NER
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example user query
query = "Where is my order ID 12345?"

# Process the query
doc = nlp(query)

# Extract entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

## Advantages
- **24/7 Availability**: Chatbots can provide support at any time, improving customer satisfaction.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the need for a large customer support team, saving costs.
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple queries simultaneously, making it scalable for growing businesses.
- **Consistency**: Provides consistent responses to common queries, reducing human error.

## Disadvantages
- **Limited Understanding**: May struggle with complex queries or nuances in language, leading to misunderstandings.
- **Lack of Empathy**: Cannot provide the emotional support that human agents can, which may be important in certain situations.
- **Maintenance**: Requires ongoing updates and training to improve accuracy and adapt to new queries.
- **Dependency on Data**: Performance heavily relies on the quality and quantity of the training data.

## Conclusion
The development of a customer support chatbot using NLP techniques can significantly enhance customer service efficiency. By following the outlined steps, companies can create a functional chatbot capable of
